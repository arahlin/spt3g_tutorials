    "Detector data can be filtered and processed in many more complicated ways.  For example, we could subtract a higher-order polynomial to filter out some smaller scale modes from the data.  We could also use a Fourier filter to do more complex filtering, such as notching out particular lines or limiting the frequency bandwidth of the timestreams.  A complete low-level analysis pipeline incorporates a variety of filters and data cuts in order to reconstruct the underlying sky with high signal-to-noise."
